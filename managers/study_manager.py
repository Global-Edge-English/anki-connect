        """
        Answer a card with the specified ease.

        Uses Anki's grade_now backend RPC, which answers any card by ID
        regardless of its queue position. This is the mechanism Anki's
        browser "Grade Now" feature uses.

        Why not sched.answer_card / sched.answerCard? Anki's Rust backend
        enforces a "top of queue" check inside pop_entry(), reached whenever
        CardAnswer.from_queue is true. The proto-to-Rust conversion at the
        service boundary hardcodes from_queue=true, so every RPC path EXCEPT
        grade_now hits that check. grade_now manually flips from_queue=false
        after conversion, skipping the queue-position requirement entirely.

        Scenarios this fixes:
          1. Cross-day answer: card fetched on day N, answered on day N+1
             after overnight new-card surfacing shuffled the queue.
          2. Rapid "again" streaks: many learning cards churn through the
             queue at short intervals, displacing the target from position 0.

        Earlier workarounds (suspending blockers to push the target to
        position 0) could not converge because get_queued_cards returns a
        bounded batch — suspending cards causes the scheduler to surface
        more from the waiting pool to fill the daily budget.

        Args:
            cardId (int): ID of the card to answer
            ease (int): Ease/difficulty rating (1=Again, 2=Hard, 3=Good, 4=Easy)
            timeTakenSeconds (float, optional): Time taken to answer in seconds.
